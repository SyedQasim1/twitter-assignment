## What external libraries did you use? What are they used for?
i. I have only used twit for fetching tweet streaming.I have used the application only auth

ii. I have used react-router-dom also for basic routing setup 


## What are the difficulties you faced while working on this project? How did you manage to get around them? Feel free to link StackOverflow posts we're all constantly learning :)


i. I have faced the issue first with api-keys so i have registered app but it took time to resolve.Then i have asked for these credentials.

ii. I have setup Rest api for filtering tweets but that does not serve the streaming and went through its docs.

iii. Then i found twit package which provides streaming for twitter apis. But only issue i am facing is regarding auth which seems permission issue to me.
